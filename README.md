## Development notes

#### What went well?

    - SwiftUI is simple and easy to use
    - Netowrking calls is easy and Async.
    - Observable objects are a great tool to move data between views.


    

#### What could be better?

    - Data should've been from the cloudDB. 
    - Seperation of MVVM can be a littler clearer.
    - Unit tests havent been done.
